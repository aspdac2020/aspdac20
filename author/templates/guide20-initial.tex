{\small\bf Abstract---
 Abstract is a brief (50-80 word) synopsis of your paper.
The purpose is to provide a quick outline of your
presentation, giving the reader an overview of the
research. It must be fit within the size allowed, which is
about 3 inches or 7.5 centimeters.}

\section{Introduction}

These introductions give you basic guidelines for preparing
initial-submission papers for the ASP-DAC 2020.

The instructions assume that you have computer that can generate a PDF
file.

These instructions have been prepared in the preferred format. For items
not addressed here, please refer to recent issues of IEEE Transactions
and simulate, as closely as possible.


\section{How to Format the Page}

\subsection{Full-Size Camera-Ready Copy}

Prepare Initial-Submission paper in full size format, on A4 size or 8 1/2''
$\times$ 11''(21.5cm $\times$ 27.9 cm) paper.

\subsection{Fonts}
The best results will be obtained if your computer word-processor has
several font sizes. Try to follow the font sizes specified in Table I as
best as you can. As an aid to gauging font size, 1 point is about
0.35mm. Use a proportional, serif font such as Times of Dutch Roman.

\begin{table}[tb]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\footnotetext[1]{\scriptsize Uppercase}
\end{minipage}
\end{table}


\subsection{Formats}

In formatting your A4-size paper, set top margin to 29mm (1.14 inches),
bottom margin to 30mm (1.18 inches), left and right margins to 15mm
(0.59 inches) If you are using paper 8 1/2'' $\times$ 11'', set top margin
to 17mm (0.67 inches), bottom margin to 24mm (0.94 inches), left
margin to 18mm (0.71 inches) and right margins to 17mm (0.67 inches). The column
width is 88mm (3.46 inches) with 5mm (0.2 inches) space between the two
columns.

You should left- and right-justify your columns. On the last page of
your paper, try to adjust the lengths of the two columns so that they
are the same. Use automatic hyphenation if you have it and check
spelling. Either digitize or paste down your figures.

%{\bf Number each of you submitted pages at the top, right corner, in
%non-photographic light blue pencil.}


\section{Figures and Tables}
Position figures and tables at the tops and bottoms of columns. Avoid
placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may
span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures;
table captions should be above the tables. Avoid placing figures and
tables before their first mention in the text. Use the abbreviation
``Fig.1'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\end{minipage}

one line are arranged like this.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

{\bf
The paper's graphics should have resolutions of 600dpi for monochrome,
300 dpi for grayscale, and 300 dpi for color. But, please do not include
too much high-resolution images or photos in your paper.
%%% Images or photos over 300dpi do not enhance the quality of your
%%% paper, but increase the size of the PDF file!
%%% Reduce the dpis of them as small as possible.
} % Modified by N. Togawa 06/01/2005

\section{Helpful Hints}

\subsection{References}
List and number all references at the end of the paper. When reffering
to them in the text, type the corresponding reference number in the
parentheses as shown at the end of this sentence \cite{key}. Number
the citations consecutively. The sentence punctuation follows the
parentheses. Do not use ``Ref.\ \cite{baz}'' or
``reference \cite{baz}'' except at the beginning of a sentence.

\subsection{Footnotes}
Number the footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual
footnote at the bottom of the column in which it is cited. Do not put
footnotes in the reference list.

\subsection{Authors names}

Give all authors' names; do not use ``et al'' unless there are six
authors or more. Papers that have not been published, even if they have
been submitted for publication, should be cited as
``unpublished'' \cite{unpub}.  Papers that have been accepted for
publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{inpress}.
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns
and element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English
citation first, followed by the original foreign language
citations \cite{trans}.

\subsection{Notice for \LaTeX\ users}

If you use \LaTeX\ to create your initial-submission paper, we recommend you
to use {\tt dvipdfm} to produce PDF files from dvi files. If you cannot
use it, please use Type1 fonts instead of ugly Type3 fonts!
